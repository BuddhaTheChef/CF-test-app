Parts 60-1 through 60-60, 60-250, and 60-741. The affirmative action clause and regulations contained in the preceding sentence shall be incorporated by reference in this Agreement.
12. 	Compliance with Licenses.
Adobe may, at its expense and no more than once every twelve (12) months, appoint an independent third party or Adobe’s internal auditor to verify the usage and number of copies and installations of the Software in use by Licensee. Any such verification shall be conducted upon no less than seven (7) business days' notice, during regular business hours at Licensee’s offices, and shall not unreasonably interfere with Licensee’s business activities. Upon Licensee’s request, Adobe (and its third-party auditors, as applicable) shall execute a commercially reasonable non-disclosure agreement with Licensee before proceeding with the verification. If such verification shows that Licensee is using a greater number of copies of the Software than that legitimately licensed, or is deploying or using the Software in any way not permitted under this Agreement and which would require additional license fees, Licensee shall pay the applicable fees for such additional usage rights or copies within thirty (30) days of invoice date, with such underpaid fees being the license fees as per Adobe’s then-current, country-specific, license fee list. If underpaid fees are in excess of five percent (5%) of the value of the fees paid under this Agreement, then Licensee shall pay such underpaid fees and Adobe’s reasonable costs of conducting the verification. This Section shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for a period of two (2) years.
13. 	Specific Provisions and Exceptions.
This Section sets forth specific provisions related to certain components of the Software as well as limited exceptions to the above terms and conditions. To the extent that any provision in this Section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this agreement, the terms stated in this Section will supersede such other term or condition.
13.1 	No Prejudice, European Union Provisions.
13.1.1 	This agreement will not prejudice the statutory rights of any party, including those dealing as consumers. For example, for consumers in New Zealand who obtain the Software for personal, domestic, or household use (not business purposes), this agreement is subject to the Consumer Guarantees Act.
13.1.2 	If you obtained the Software in the European Union (EU), you usually reside in the EU, and you are a consumer (that is you use the Software for personal, non-business related purposes), then Section 7 (Limited Warranty) does not apply to your purchase and use of the Software. Instead, Adobe warrants for a period of 2 years from purchase that the Software provides the functionalities set forth in the Documentation (the “agreed upon functionalities”) when used on the recommended hardware configuration. Non-substantial variation from the agreed upon functionalities will not establish any warranty rights. THIS WARRANTY DOES NOT APPLY TO SOFTWARE THAT YOU USE ON A PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT, STARTER, OR PRODUCT SAMPLER BASIS, OR TO FONT SOFTWARE, OR TO THE EXTENT THAT THE SOFTWARE FAILS TO PERFORM BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN ALTERED BY YOU. To make a warranty claim, you must notify the Adobe Customer Support Department during this 2 year period, providing details of proof of purchase of the Software. Adobe will verify with you whether there is a defect in the Software or advise you that the error arises because you have not installed the Software correctly (in which case, Adobe shall assist you). If there is a defect in the Software, you may request from Adobe either a refund or a repaired or replacement copy of the Software. Requests must be accompanied by proof of purchase. In the event your warranty details are substantiated, Adobe will meet your request for repaired or replacement Software, unless it is not reasonable for Adobe to do so, in which case Adobe will provide you with a refund. For warranty assistance, please contact the Adobe Customer Support Department.
Please note that the provisions of Section 8 (Limitation of Liability) will continue to apply to any damages claims you make in respect of your use of the Software. Nonetheless, Adobe shall be liable for direct losses that are reasonably foreseeable in the event of a breach by Adobe of this agreement. You are advised to take all reasonable measures to avoid and reduce damages, in particular by making backup copies of the Software and your computer data.
This Agreement, and in particular, this Section 13.1.2, is intended to describe your rights (including your statutory rights) in the event there should be problems with your use of the Software. If your statutory rights are greater than this description, your statutory rights shall apply.
13.1.3 	Nothing included in this agreement (including Section 2.6.1) shall limit any non-waivable right to decompile the Software that you may enjoy under applicable law. For example, if you are located in the European Union (EU), you may have the right under certain conditions specified in the applicable law to decompile the Software if it is necessary to do so in order to achieve interoperability of the Software with another software program, and you have first asked Adobe in writing to provide the information necessary to achieve such operability and Adobe has not made such information available. In addition, such decompilation may only be performed by you or someone else entitled to use a copy of the Software on your behalf. Adobe has the right to impose reasonable conditions before providing such information. Any information supplied by Adobe or obtained by you, as permitted hereunder, may only be used by you for the purpose described herein and may not be disclosed to any third party or used to create any software that is substantially similar to the expression of the Software or used for any other act that infringes the copyright of Adobe or its licensors.
14. 	Pre-release Software Additional Terms.
If the Software is pre-commercial release or beta software (“Pre-release Software”), then this section applies. The Pre-release Software does not represent final product from Adobe, and may contain bugs, errors, or other problems that could cause system or other failures and data loss. Adobe may never commercially release the Pre-release Software. If Licensee received the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate written agreement, such as the Adobe  Inc.License Agreement for Pre- release Software, then Licensee’s use of the Software is also governed by such agreement. Licensee will promptly return or destroy all copies of Pre-release Software upon the earlier of Adobe’s request or upon Adobe’s commercial release of such Software. LICENSEE’S USE OF PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE IS AT ITS OWN RISK. SEE SECTIONS 7 AND 8 FOR LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS RELATED TO PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.
15. 	Term and Termination.
This Agreement shall remain in effect until any material breach of this Agreement by Licensee occurs, upon which this Agreement shall automatically terminate. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, Licensee shall discontinue use of the Software and shall destroy the Software, Documentation, and all copies thereof. Termination shall not, however, relieve either party of obligations incurred prior to the termination. The following Sections shall survive termination of this Agreement: 1 (Definitions), 5 (Intellectual Property Rights), 7.2 (Disclaimer), 8 (Limitation of Liability), 9 (Governing Law), 10 (General Provisions), 11 (Notice to U.S. Government End Users), 13 (Specific Provisions and Exceptions), and 15 (Term and Termination).
16. 	Third-Party Beneficiary.
Licensee acknowledges and agrees that Adobe’s licensors (and/or Adobe if Licensee obtained the Software from any party other than Adobe) are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, with the right to enforce the obligations set forth herein with respect to the respective technology of such licensors and/or Adobe.
17. 	Educational Software Product.
If the Software accompanying this agreement is Educational Software Product (i.e., Software manufactured and distributed for use only by educational end users), Licensee is not entitled to use the Software unless Licensee qualifies in its jurisdiction as an educational end user.
